#Live From Here Music Venue reviews

This application allows a user view different concert/music venues and allows them to post a review, and a rating.

In addition, it allows a user to edit a submitted review, and an admin to edit or delete a venue.

We are building this application with scalability in mind and plan to implement additional features such as, google maps, admin profiles, user profiles, a search bar, and other misc.quality of life changes.

#Technology
Java, JavaScript, Hibernate, Spring, React, Maven, PostgreSQL, CSS, HTML.
